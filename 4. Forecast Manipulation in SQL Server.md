Now that we have the historical and forecast data merged and standardized, we can decide upon a forecast. Recall that I generated 5 quantile forecasts. In this example, those were p62, p50, p38, p25, p12. From those, we have to choose one:  

For actuals, set both the units and the gross $ to historicals. Since actuals are spread across each quantile, just pick any.  

```
UPDATE [hist_analysis_Aug_Sku_v4] 
	SET [unit_frcst_use] = [p50]
                         WHERE [measure] IN ('actuals');
             
UPDATE [hist_analysis_Aug_Sku_v4] 
	SET [$_frcst_use] = [gross_p50]
                       WHERE [measure] IN ('actuals');
```
